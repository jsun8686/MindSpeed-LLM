# Async Activation Offload

## Background and Challenges

As model parameter counts grow and sequence lengths increase, memory demand during training rises sharply. Current approaches to optimizing activation memory mainly rely on activation recomputation and sequence parallelism. These techniques have the following bottlenecks:

- Activation recomputation saves memory by discarding activation values from the forward pass and recomputing them during the backward pass. This introduces a large amount of redundant computation.
- Sequence parallelism can reduce memory use by distributing the computation for a single sequence across multiple devices. However, frequent cross-device communication can be difficult to hide effectively.

To address these challenges, you can use the asynchronous activation offload strategy.

## Solution

- Memory optimization: Offload activation tensors from the device side to the host side, which significantly reduces peak memory usage.
- Asynchronous execution: Use multiple streams to make offload (device-to-host, D2H) and load (host-to-device, H2D) operations asynchronous. Therefore, the copy overhead can overlap with computation.
- Early prefetch: During the backward pass, use the prefetch mechanism to load the tensors needed next in advance and hide load latency.

## Usage

This feature supports organizing tensor lifecycles by block, which lets you manage activation values for different model blocks flexibly. The following example shows how to use it.

```python
with async_save_on_cpu(
    h2d_stream=h2d_stream,
    d2h_stream=d2h_stream,
    block_idx=block_idx,
    depth=depth,
    custom_check_fn=your_check_fn
):
    # The forward pass for one block of the model. This is only an example
    output = layer(input)
```

### Parameter Details

- `h2d_stream` / `d2h_stream`: The H2D and D2H streams. It is recommended that you create dedicated global streams for H2D and D2H tasks so they run asynchronously with the computation stream.
- `block_idx`: The index of the current block in the model.
- `depth`: The total number of layers in the model.
- `custom_check_fn`: A custom validation function. Only activation values that return `True` after validation are offloaded. In practice, you should select parts with heavy computation and a small activation footprint, and combine them with a recomputation strategy. For activation values with a large activation footprint and short compute time, use recomputation. For activation values with a small activation footprint and long compute time, use offload. Otherwise, the overhead of H2D and D2H becomes too large and is difficult to hide with computation.

## Use Cases and Results

- Long-sequence scenarios: The computation cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. With this approach, you can offload the activation values from the forward pass of self-attention and skip recomputing self-attention during the recomputation stage. In typical scenarios, end-to-end performance improves by more than 20 percent.
- FSDP2 scenarios: Under the FSDP2 distributed strategy, model parameters are partitioned and gathered. For shorter sequence lengths, computation time cannot mask communication time. You can use this approach to offload the activation values at the recomputation entry point. After saving memory, you can increase the micro-batch size or sequence length to raise the compute-to-communication ratio. In typical scenarios, end-to-end performance improves by more than 60 percent.

## MemFabric Remote DRAM Pool Backend (FSDP2 / Qwen3-MoE)

Besides the default pinned host-buffer backend, the FSDP2 backend (currently wired into
Qwen3-MoE) supports offloading activations to a
[MemFabric](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/memfabric_hybrid) cross-node DRAM memory pool over
DEVICE_RDMA transport. This is useful when local host memory is insufficient or when you
want to exploit the DRAM of remote memory nodes.

### Deployment order (config store hosted on the FAR side, auto-rank mode)

1. Start the FAR daemon on the first remote-memory node (it hosts the config store):
   ```bash
   python examples/fsdp2/qwen3_moe/memfabric_far_daemon.py \
       --store-url tcp://<far_ip>:8572 --with-store \
       --nic tcp://<far_ip>:10005 --world-size 16
   ```
2. Start the remaining FAR daemons on the other remote-memory nodes (they wait for the
   store, then register themselves).
3. Launch training (the NEAR side). Every training rank initializes ralloc with
   `auto_ranking`, records the `torch_rank <-> ralloc_rank` mapping plus a
   "acquired block -> contributor rank" table; training-framework rank ids are never used
   to configure ralloc.

### Training-side arguments (parallel group)

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `activation_offload` | Enable async activation offload |
| `activation_offload_backend` | `memfabric` (default) or `pinned` |
| `offload_pool_size_gb` | Total remote DRAM acquired per rank |
| `offload_extend_block_gb` | Granularity of each `extend_remote_mem` request (2M aligned) |
| `offload_register_mode` | `per_tensor` (default): register/unregister the NPU tensor memory around each copy to take the one-hop DEVICE_RDMA path; `none`: skip registration and fall back to the internal 128MB bounce path (slower) |
| `mf_store_url` | FAR-hosted config store url (required) |
| `mf_nic` | RoCE nic url required by DEVICE_RDMA (required) |
| `mf_world_size` | ralloc window capacity; must match the FAR daemons |

See `examples/fsdp2/qwen3_moe/tune_qwen3_30b_4k_fsdp2_A2_memfabric.sh/.yaml` for a
complete example.

### Implementation notes

- DEVICE_RDMA `copy_data` is host-synchronous (the async flag is not supported), so
  asynchrony is achieved by a background offload thread coordinated with NPU events: the
  pack hook records a compute-stream event; the thread waits on it before issuing the
  L2GH copy; device memory is released at the next block boundary. The backward unpack
  performs a synchronous GH2L copy and prefetches the next block.
- The training side manages a 4K-aligned fine-grained sub-allocator over the acquired
  remote blocks (block requests are 2M aligned); slots are recycled with the tensor
  lifecycle.
- When the pool is exhausted, offload degrades gracefully (activations stay on device)
  and training continues.
